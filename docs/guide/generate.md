# Generate an SDK

## Base client

```sh
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --output ./src/generated/api
```

The TypeScript target generates the client, types, runtime code, and OpenAPI metadata.
Rerun the command whenever the OpenAPI file changes.

For repeated local generation, keep the first command unchanged and add
`--incremental` on later runs. This updates changed generated files without
making file watchers reprocess every unchanged file.

```sh
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --output ./src/generated/api \
  --incremental
```

Do not edit generated files in place. Incremental generation verifies their
manifest hashes and stops if an owned file differs from the previous output.
Files you add outside the manifest are preserved.

With a self-contained local OpenAPI file, an unchanged input and option set also
skips compilation and source emission. Stdin, HTTP(S), external `$ref`, and
schema-extension inputs still run the complete pipeline while retaining the
same managed-output safety.

## Generate Webhook and Callback code

When the OpenAPI file defines a Webhook or Callback that your application
receives, add `--with server`.

```sh
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --with server \
  --output ./src/generated/api
```

This adds `server/webhooks.ts` and `server/callbacks.ts`.

For most applications, generation ends here: rerun the same command whenever
the OpenAPI document changes and commit the generated source with the change.

## Generation errors

`generate` checks the OpenAPI file and selected options before writing code.
There is no separate `validate` command.

Errors include the relevant OpenAPI location when available and explain what
needs to change. Warnings do not stop generation.

If any error occurs, the existing output remains unchanged. This prevents a
failed command from leaving partially generated code.

## CI

Run the same `generate` command in CI and treat its exit status as the gate.
Generate into a temporary directory when CI only needs validation; compare or
copy that directory when generated source is checked in.

```sh
output="$(mktemp -d)/api"
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --output "$output"
```

Use the command's exit status as the CI check.

::: details Advanced: locked remote references

Remote `$ref` values are disabled by default. Allow the HTTPS origin and create
the reference lock the first time they are fetched:

```sh
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --output ./src/generated/api \
  --allow-remote-ref https://schemas.example.test \
  --update-ref-lock
```

Later runs verify the remote content against the lock. `--offline` uses only
previously cached references and does not open a network connection.

::: details Advanced: custom JSON Schema vocabularies

When the OpenAPI file uses a required custom JSON Schema vocabulary, provide a
local extension manifest:

```sh
openapi-sdkgen generate \
  --input ./openapi.json \
  --target typescript \
  --output ./src/generated/api \
  --schema-extension ./schema-extension.json \
  --update-ref-lock
```

The extension runs only while generating and is not included in application
code. See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md) for the available options.
